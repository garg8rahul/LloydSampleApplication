# Lloyd Sample Android Project 

This Android project is a template for building modern Android applications using Kotlin, MVVM architecture, Jetpack Compose, Navigation Component, Retrofit for REST API, Coroutines, State, Flow, Dependency Injection (DI) with Hilt, and unit testing.

## Features

- **Kotlin:** The project is written in Kotlin, which is a modern and expressive programming language for Android development.

- **MVVM Architecture:** The project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and a more maintainable codebase.

- **Jetpack Compose:** The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit that simplifies UI development.

- **Navigation Component:** Navigation is handled using the Android Navigation Component, making it easy to manage and navigate between different screens.

- **Retrofit & Coroutines:** Network requests are made with Retrofit, and asynchronous operations are managed using Coroutines for clean and efficient background tasks.

- **State & Flow:** UI state management is handled with State and Flow, ensuring a reactive and maintainable UI.

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Dependency injection is implemented using Hilt, making it easy to manage dependencies and provide testability.

- **Unit Testing:** The project includes unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
